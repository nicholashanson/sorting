This application is developed using Python and tkinter.

The application is designed to be extensible: new sorting alogorithms and views can be easily added.

## Performance

As expected, bubblesort and cocktailsort perform progressively worse as the data set grows.

Insertionsort and selectionsort have better performance.

Quicksort and bucketsort
